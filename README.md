## Interface
Source files in src/GithubSearchInterface/

- [org.json.jar](http://www.java2s.com/Code/JarDownload/org.json/org.json.jar.zip) (zipped)

## Project Specification

- [x] Crawl (a part of) the publicly available GitHub code.
- [x] Filter out one programming language that you feel comfortable with. (Java)
- [ ] Process the files and separate class names, method names, modifiers (for example public, private, static, final etc.), variable names â€“ things that you may want to search and filter!
- [ ] Index it into elasticsearch (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch), or another search engine of your choice.
- [ ] Create an interface where you can search and filter methods or classes based on the metadata you have created.
- [ ] A sample query could be methodName:quicksort AND returnType:List<Number> i i.e. search for quicksort, and filter by methods with returnType List. What would you want to search for?


## Additional criteria, 2 needed for C, 3 needed for B etc

- [ ] The solution to the problem is novel in some respect (i.e., it has not been published before in a book, report, article or paper). A novel combination of known techniques is fine.
- [ ] The results are evaluated, preferably on realistic data, preferably using methods from the literature.
- [ ] The poster presentation is clear and understandable to another student who has not read the report or references in it.
- [ ] The report is clear, complete, technically correct, and written in grammatically correct English.
